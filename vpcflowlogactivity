VPC Flow Log Activity

Objective
Students will create a VPC and set up VPC Flow Logs to monitor network traffic. They will then use the AWS CLI to retrieve and analyze these logs using either `awk` or `grep`.

Activity Breakdown

Part 1: Setting up the VPC

1. Create a VPC:
   Name the VPC `FlowLogPractice` with a single public subnet.

2. Create a VPC Flow Log:
   - Go to the VPC dashboard and select the newly created VPC.
   - Navigate to the "Flow Logs" tab, then click "Create Flow Log."
   - Set the following configurations:
     - Filter: `All`
     - Destination: `CloudWatch Logs`
     - Log Group: Create a new log group named `FlowLogPractice-Logs`.

3. Launch an EC2 Instance:
   - In the public subnet of the VPC, launch a basic Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu EC2 instance. This will generate some network traffic.
   - Ensure the security group allows ICMP (ping) and SSH traffic.

Part 2: Generating Traffic and Retrieving Flow Logs

1. Generate Traffic:
   - Connect to the EC2 instance.
   - Generate network traffic by pinging a public IP (e.g., `ping 8.8.8.8 -c 4`).

2. Retrieve Flow Logs:
   - Use the AWS CLI to retrieve the latest log events from the CloudWatch log group:
     ```bash
     aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name FlowLogPractice-Logs --log-stream-name <LogStreamName> --limit 100
     ```
   - Note: Replace `<LogStreamName>` with the appropriate log stream name from CloudWatch Logs.

Part 3: Analyzing Flow Logs using `awk` or `grep`

1. Download Flow Logs:
   - Save the output of the logs to a file on the local machine:
     ```bash
     aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name FlowLogPractice-Logs --log-stream-name <LogStreamName> --limit 100 > flow_logs.txt
     ```

2. Analyze Flow Logs:
   - Use `grep` to filter logs for successful network connections:
     
   - Alternatively, use `awk` to extract specific fields (e.g., source IP, destination IP, and status):
    
     This command will print the source IP, destination IP, and the status of the traffic.

Discussion Points
- What kind of network traffic is visible in the logs?
- How can you use these logs to monitor and troubleshoot VPC network activity?

Deliverables
- Students should provide the results of their `grep` or `awk` commands showing specific network traffic patterns.
